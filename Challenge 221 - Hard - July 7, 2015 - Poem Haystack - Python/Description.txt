Description

Today we're going to try something a little bit different.
You're are going to be given a file with 50,000 lines of text in it. 49,997 of those lines are going to be gibberish, but 3 lines are going to be part of a famous poem. Your task today is to find those three lines.

A few notes:
All text in the file is lower-case
All lines contain nothing but alphabetic characters, spaces, and a few pieces of punctuation
The lines of poetry are written in English
The three lines of the poem is in the file in the right order, but split up with lines of gibberish.

Formal inputs & outputs
Input
The input for this challenge is this[1] aforementioned file. Download it and use it as input for your problems.

Output
The three lines of the poem, in the right order.
Note that it might be the case that you reduce the number of possible lines to some very low number (say, 10-20 lines), after which you can easily use visual inspection to find the right lines. This is an acceptable way to solve the problem, but I highly encourage you to try and find a way to print only the correct lines.
Oh, and by the way: if you happen to figure out what the right lines are exactly, either from visual inspection, reading it in a comment here (if you do solve the problem and wish to post the output, please indent the output with four space so as to hide the text as a spoiler), or any other way, you are not allowed to just put in a search function in your code for the correct words. That's cheating :). You have to figure out a way to do it "legitimately", and write the code pretending you have no idea what the lines are supposed to be.
